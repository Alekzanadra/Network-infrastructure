# 1. Synopsis/Executive Summary
The report can be many pages in length. For this reason, you must include an
Executive Summary that succinctly states the major points of the document at the
beginning of the document. The Executive Summary should be no more than one
page and should be targeted at the managers and key project participants of
GeoTech who will decide whether to accept your design. Although the Executive
Summary can include some technical information, it should not provide technical
details
